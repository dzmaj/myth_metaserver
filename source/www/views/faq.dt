                        You do not need to register to play. Guests can chat and play, but registered
                        users have a few options guests do not. Registered users can play in "Tourney"
                        rooms. The server links the games and statistics of a registered user to their 
                        account which is easier to find when needed.
                    p.
                        To register, click the "Account" button at the top and follow the instructions
                        to link a Steam account after which you will receive credentials to log into the
                        metaserver. You can set your nick name, team name and colors as usual in Myth 2.

                        update. Go to the <a href="http://www.projectmagma.net/" target="_blank">Project

                        If you get this message, it means you need to update your version of Myth II.
                        If you are on the latest version, just redownload it and reinstall it as it could
                        have gotten tweaked after you got it.

                        Rooms with the "Films" icon will save the film of the game you played to the
                        server. Great for tournaments and anyone who wants to show a film to someone
                        without having to manually upload it. If you don't want a game film recorded to
                        the server, play in a room without this icon. You can find the films in the
                        "Games" section of the site.

                    p.
                        Dot commands are text based functions which are entered into chat to trigger
                        certain actions. Myth 2 has some that can be used in the metaserver lobby and
                        others in the pregame lobby when joining a game. The GoS metaserver has a few dot
                        commands of its own that can be helpful. To see a list of available commands type
                        ".help".      
                    .centered <img src="/faq/gos_faq_13.png" width="150" height="50" />
                    p.
                        One of the more useful dot commands is ".games". This command tells you who is
                        hosting which game. It also informs you on how long the game has been in
                        progress, which can be useful for co-operative games.
